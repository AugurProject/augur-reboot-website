Based on recent coding sessions, i've collected some observations with regards the lack of updated understanding of claude code to perform well:

- doesn't know where the styles are
- with v4, no tailwind config is needed, follow that mantra
- make it use existing server to test rather than spawining a new one
- outdated knowledge of tailwindcss theme variables
	- https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme
- outdated knowledge of tailwind custom styles
	- https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles#adding-custom-variants

Suggest improvements to claude memory so these will be handled moving forward
