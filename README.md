## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Development Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project:

**Core Development**
| Command           | Action                                                    |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`     | Starts development server at `localhost:4321`            |
| `npm run build`   | Builds production site to `./dist/`                      |
| `npm run preview` | Builds and previews with Wrangler (Cloudflare)          |
| `npm run deploy`  | Deploys to Cloudflare Pages                              |
| `npm run cf-typegen` | Generates Cloudflare Worker types                     |

**Fork Risk Monitoring**
| Command                    | Action                                                |
| :------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run build:fork-data`  | Calculate fork risk data using blockchain scripts     |
| `npm run typecheck`        | Type-check all TypeScript files                       |
| `npm run lint`             | Run Biome linter with project standards               |

### Development Workflow

The development server provides:
- Hot module replacement for rapid iteration
- TypeScript checking and error reporting
- Tailwind CSS compilation with custom utilities
- React component hydration in development mode

For development questions or issues, refer to the project documentation in the `docs/` directory or check the component implementations for usage patterns.

### Styling System

The project uses Tailwind CSS 4.1 with a CSS-first approach:

- **Global Styles**: Located in `src/styles/global.css`
- **Theme Configuration**: Uses `@theme` directive instead of config files
- **Custom Utilities**: Defined with `@utility` directive
- **Component Styles**: Scoped styles within Astro components

## Deployment

### Dual Deployment Architecture

This project maintains two deployment targets:

**Main Branch (Cloudflare Pages)**:
- Primary deployment target
- Uses `@astrojs/cloudflare` adapter
- Optimized for edge computing and global CDN
- Supports server-side rendering capabilities

**GitHub Pages Branch**:
- Automatically synced from main via GitHub Actions
- Static site deployment with different base path configuration
- Provides fallback hosting option
- Uses GitHub's global CDN infrastructure

### Automatic Syncing & Data Updates

Changes to the main branch trigger an automated workflow that:
1. Syncs source code changes to the `gh-pages` branch
2. Preserves deployment-specific configurations
3. **Calculates fresh fork risk data** from Ethereum mainnet
4. Updates the live site with current dispute bond metrics
5. Maintains both deployment targets without manual intervention
6. Ensures consistency across both hosting platforms

**Fork Risk Data Collection:**
- Runs automatically every hour via GitHub Actions
- Uses public Ethereum RPC endpoints with failover
- Monitors Augur v2 dispute bonds and calculates fork risk percentage
- Zero infrastructure costs - completely serverless data pipeline

### Manual Deployment

To deploy manually to Cloudflare Pages:
```sh
npm run deploy
```

## Fork Risk Monitoring System

### Overview
The website features a real-time fork risk monitoring system for Augur v2, displaying the current risk of a protocol fork based on active dispute bonds. This system uses blockchain data to calculate risk percentages and provides an interactive gauge visualization.

### Architecture
- **Data Collection**: Node.js scripts using ethers.js to query Ethereum mainnet
- **Storage**: Static JSON files updated via GitHub Actions (zero infrastructure cost)  
- **Frontend**: React Context API for state management with 5-minute auto-refresh
- **Visualization**: Custom SVG gauge with animated risk levels

### Risk Calculation
Fork risk is calculated using the simple formula:
```
Risk % = (Largest Dispute Bond / 275,000 REP) × 100
```

Where 275,000 REP represents the fork threshold (2.5% of total REP supply).

### Data Sources
- **Primary**: LlamaRPC, LinkPool, PublicNode, 1RPC public endpoints
- **Failover**: Automatic fallback across 5 RPC providers
- **Update Frequency**: Hourly via GitHub Actions, 5-minute UI refresh

### Development Features
In development mode, access demo controls with `Ctrl+Shift+D`:
- **No Disputes**: Clean baseline state
- **Low Risk**: 0.4-10% of fork threshold scenarios  
- **Moderate Risk**: 10-25% threshold scenarios
- **High Risk**: 25-75% threshold scenarios
- **Critical Risk**: 75-98% threshold scenarios

Demo mode is automatically disabled in production builds.
