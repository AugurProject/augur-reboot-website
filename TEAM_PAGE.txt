Who We Are: Foundation & Teams
The Lituus Foundation is the steward of Augur’s revival. It holds and deploys treasury funds to support independent teams working toward the project’s success.

To encourage innovation, redundancy, and diverse problem-solving strategies, the Foundation has funded two parallel teams:

Lituus Labs: Focused on oracle architecture, cryptoeconomic security, and protocol design. Their current work centers on a generalized, finalizing oracle.

Dark Florist: Focused on alternative oracle structures, user-facing applications, and incentive models. Their approach emphasizes a non-finalizing oracle design.

Each team brings its own perspective to solving the core challenges of decentralized truth, and both contribute directly to Augur’s evolving roadmap.

“Two teams, two approaches. One mission: revive Augur.”

This dual-team model ensures that ideas are rigorously explored from multiple angles — accelerating progress, increasing resilience, and reducing single-point failure risk.

Where We're Headed
Our next milestones include:

Finalizing the new oracle architecture, with academic-style documentation and formal reasoning

Expanding REP token accessibility across more exchanges and L2s

Relaunching an Augur-native market protocol once oracle security and fee-routing mechanisms are finalized

We see Augur not just as a product, but as an evolving open infrastructure project — a decentralized public good that anyone can contribute to or build on.
