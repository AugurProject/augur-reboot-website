*A test of Augur's forking mechanism is coming. This will strengthen the oracle, demonstrate the process, and ensure every REP holder is ready for future forks.*

## ⚖️ What is the fork, and why does it matter?

[Micah Zoltu](https://3.go-fund-micah.eth.limo/blog.html), current Augur developer, created a crowdsourcer which raised enough funds to trigger a fork as a planned experiment to test the oracle and dispute system.

([See Micah's post](https://listed.to/authors/33689/posts/66981))

A fork is Augur's ultimate backstop, a codified social defense that makes attacking the system economically irrational.

When oracle disputes reach the threshold (2.5% of REP staked in 1 round), Augur splits into parallel universes for each outcome. Every REP holder must then migrate to the universe they believe reflects reality.

That is why **REP is not a passive asset**. Holders must occasionally act to uphold the oracle.

## 🏛️ The Foundation's Role

The **Lituus Foundation** supports this initiative. While we will not participate in the fork itself, we will steward a smooth process and work to minimize any negative outcomes.

## 📅 What Happens Next

Micah has closed the crowdsourcer and begun building the decentralized tooling required for the fork.

Once this is ready (soon™), the process will proceed in two phases:

1. **Dispute Game (~2 months)**
   A market is brought to resolution where REP is staked back and forth on competing outcomes until it is forced into a fork.

2. **Fork (60 days)**
   The universe splits, and all REP holders must migrate to the branch they believe reflects reality. Since this is a test fork, and likely with real forks, the answer will be obvious.
   REP that doesn't migrate during the 60-day window becomes worthless and permanently stranded in the old universe.

A migration UI will be provided for on-chain REP holders to connect their wallets and complete the migration.

## 💼 If You Hold REP on an Exchange

Action may or may not be necessary.

Lituus Foundation is reaching out to 17 exchanges identified as having REP on their books, asking them to facilitate the migration on behalf of their users.

- If your exchange confirms participation, **no action is required**.
- If your exchange declines, you will need to **withdraw your REP from the exchange and use the on-chain migration UI**.

A live tracker of exchange responses will be published soon.

## 🔄 If You Hold REPv1

A conversion tool (REPv1 to REPv2) will be provided for on-chain holders.

If your REPv1 is on an exchange, refer to the "If You Hold REP on an Exchange" section.

## 🧩 Participating in the Dispute Game (Optional)

The dispute game is open to REP holders via the planned on-chain tooling.

It will run for **~20 rounds,** which will take between 12–20 weeks, during which Micah's 200,000 REP will be staked on the incorrect outcome side.

Those that successfully stake on the truthful side will earn **40% extra REP** after the fork concludes.

## 💰 What about DAI/ETH tied up in finalized markets?

If you own winning shares in any existing v1/v2 markets, you are not impacted.

You may convert them into DAI/ETH at any time, regardless of what happens with the fork.

If this applies to you, contact the team on Discord for help.

## 🌍 How to Help

The success of this process depends on **every REP holder** being aware and ready to act.

If you are a long-time holder or community member, now is the moment to re-engage.

Help us spread the word and wake the sleeping REP.
