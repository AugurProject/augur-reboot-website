*Ten years since Augur first went live, a fitting time for its resurgence*

![Augur Decade milestone](/blog/augurs-decade-1.webp)

## 🔥 Q3 Summary

Our third fiscal quarter (fourth calendar quarter) was productive and eventful. Micah's fork crowdsourcer filled, putting Augur on track to demonstrate crypto's first algorithmic fork and shifting development focus toward fork and migration tooling.

On the Lituus side, much of the quarter was spent preparing the whitepaper. Strong external feedback led us to take additional time to refine the document, moving the release into this quarter.

Across both development tracks, maintaining a unified REP remains a key design goal. While this remains an open question, a single token securing both protocols would allow the community to benefit from progress on all fronts.

**Highlights this quarter:**

- Fork crowdsourcer completed, enabling live fork preparation
- Whitepaper entered final review following extensive external feedback
- Continued parallel development across B2C and B2B oracle designs
- Active work toward unified REP constraints and architecture
- Fork and migration tooling development underway

## ⚖️ Micah's Fork

**Summary**

The fork is Augur's ultimate security mechanism, designed to resolve disputes by forcing REP holders to collectively choose the honest universe. Micah previously launched a crowdsourcer to raise the 200k REP required to trigger the fork, which filled this quarter and opened the path toward execution.

**This quarter:**

- Micah's fork crowdsourcer successfully filled
- Community-led development of fork and migration tooling progressed
- Active coordination with centralized exchanges on fork handling

**Next quarter:**

- Continued community development and testing of fork tooling
- Potential progression toward the fork process, subject to community readiness and timing
- Clearer guidance for REP holders as timelines and tooling solidify
- Updates on exchange handling as details are finalized

The fork reminds us that **REP is not a passive asset**. Participation matters, and economic weight follows only those who show up to defend truth.

## 📈 Liquidity & Token Support

**Summary**

This quarter, liquidity efforts focused on preparing for the fork by establishing functional relationships with exchanges that custody REP.

**This quarter:**

- Engaged exchanges holding REP on their books (17 total)
- Coordinated on fork and migration handling
- Maintained on-chain REP liquidity

**Next quarter:**

- Continue exchange coordination as tooling matures
- Launch a tracker with exchange responses on fork participation
- Maintain REP token liquidity & support

Fork readiness depends on access and coordination. This work supports a smooth migration and opens the door to future collaboration.

## 🌍 Presence & Ecosystem Growth

**Summary**

Q3 focused on measured, high-signal ecosystem engagement, paced intentionally alongside research progress and fork preparation.

**This quarter:**

- Participated on prediction market panels and X Spaces
- Attended two major conferences to strengthen Augur relationships
- Continued targeted engagement

**Next quarter:**

- Increase podcast and X Spaces appearances to explain the whitepaper
- Get loud to ensure REP holders are aware of the fork
- Engage respected voices to amplify vital information

As fork preparation advances, we are focused on matching the scale of what may become one of the most significant onchain events with broad ecosystem visibility, while providing clear and precise guidance on participation.

## 🧪 Research & Development

**Summary**

Q3 was a research-heavy quarter focused on strengthening Augur's oracle design through deeper analysis, external review, and continued work across two complementary development tracks.

Much of the quarter was spent preparing the whitepaper and incorporating feedback from academics, researchers, and independent reviewers.

**This quarter:**

- Continued parallel R&D across B2C and B2B oracle designs
- Integrated extensive external feedback into the whitepaper
- Explored paths toward a unified REP across both systems

A key focus remains unification. While both designs are progressing, maintaining a single REP token is an open problem. Solving it would allow the community to benefit from adoption across multiple usecases without fragmentation, but doing so safely requires careful tradeoffs and further research.

**Next quarter:**

- Release the whitepaper for public review
- Publish a post explaining the two oracle designs and their goals
- Continue working toward a coherent long-term architecture

Decentralized oracles remain difficult and convoluted, and this quarter reinforced the importance of patience in getting it right.

## 🔮 2026 and Beyond

2026 marks ten years since Augur deployed to Ethereum, a milestone that invites both reflection and renewed ambition. Augur was among the earliest attempts to build decentralized truth infrastructure, and many of the challenges identified then remain unsolved today.

As we enter this next phase, the focus is on getting the fundamentals right: a robust oracle design, a security model proven in practice, and a community prepared to participate when it matters. The fork, the whitepaper, and ongoing work toward a unified REP all point to the same goal of building infrastructure that can endure uncertainty while thriving in prosperity.

A decade on, the mission is unchanged, but the tools, understanding, and stakes are higher.

2026 is the year of Augur.
