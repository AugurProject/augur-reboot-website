# How Disputes & Bonds Work

Disputes are the core mechanism that makes Augur work. When people disagree about a market outcome, they challenge each other using bonds—financial commitments that keep everyone honest.

## A Real-World Example

Imagine a market asks: **"Will BTC reach $100,000 in 2025?"**

1. **Reporter A** says YES and locks up REP as their report bond
2. **Reporter B** disagrees and says NO—they lock up 2x the initial bond amount to dispute
3. **Reporter C** thinks B is wrong and says YES again—they lock up 2x B's bond (4x initial)
4. This continues escalating until everyone agrees... or the bond reaches 275,000 REP and a fork is triggered

## What is a Dispute Bond?

A dispute bond is REP (Augur's governance token) that you must lock up to challenge a market outcome. It serves three purposes:

1. **Skin in the game:** Disputers must risk their own capital to challenge outcomes
2. **Spam prevention:** High bond amounts deter frivolous disputes
3. **Fair resolution:** If your dispute is correct, you get your bond back plus a fee

## The Dispute Process Step-by-Step

## Bond Escalation Example

Here's how bonds grow with each dispute round:

<ProseCard>
| Round | Bond Size | Risk Level |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| 1st Dispute | 1,000 REP | Low |
| 2nd Dispute | 2,000 REP | Low |
| 3rd Dispute | 4,000 REP | Medium |
| 4th Dispute | 8,000 REP | High |
| 5th+ Disputes | 16,000+ REP | Extreme |

*Actual bond amounts vary based on protocol parameters, but the doubling pattern is consistent.*
</ProseCard>

## Why 275,000 REP?

The 275,000 REP threshold was chosen as a balance:

<ProseCard>
- **ACCESSIBILITY:** Low enough that disputes can escalate naturally
- **SAFETY:** High enough that only serious, well-funded disputes trigger forks
- **GOVERNANCE:** Ensures protocol-level disagreements go to REP holders to choose
</ProseCard>

## Bond Economics: Winning and Losing

<ProseCard>
| OUTCOME | WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR BOND |
|---------|--------------------------|
| **Your Dispute Is Correct** | **You get your bond back + a fee**<br/>The fee is additional REP awarded for being right |
| **Your Dispute Is Incorrect** | **You lose your bond**<br/>It gets redistributed to winning disputers or the protocol |
</ProseCard>

## How Fork Risk is Calculated

The fork meter shows a simple calculation:

<ProseCard class="text-center">
(Largest Dispute Bond ÷ 275,000 REP) × 100 = Fork Risk %
</ProseCard>

### Understanding the Formula

**Largest Dispute Bond**: This is the single largest bond currently active across all markets. Why track the largest? Because it determines how close we are to the fork threshold.

**Example**: If the largest active dispute is 150,000 REP, the next challenger would need to post ~300,000 REP to dispute it—which exceeds 275,000 and triggers a fork immediately.

### Two Calculation Examples

<ProseCard>
**EXAMPLE 1: LOW RISK**

Current largest dispute bond: **15,000 REP**

(15,000 ÷ 275,000) × 100 = **5.5% risk**

*Interpretation: Disputes are active but still far from fork. The next dispute would need ~30,000 REP.*
</ProseCard>

<ProseCard>
**EXAMPLE 2: HIGH RISK**

Current largest dispute bond: **200,000 REP**

(200,000 ÷ 275,000) × 100 = **73% risk**

*Interpretation: Close to fork. The next dispute would need ~400,000 REP, exceeding the threshold. Fork is likely with one more escalation.*
</ProseCard>

## What Happens When Fork Conditions Are Met?

Once a dispute bond reaches or exceeds 275,000 REP:

<ProseCard>
- **FORK PERIOD:** A 60-day window begins for REP holders to migrate their REP
- **MARKETS FREEZE:** No new trades on disputed markets
- **REP MIGRATION:** You choose which fork version you support
- **WINNING FORK:** The fork with the most REP support becomes canonical
- **RESOLUTION:** Markets settle according to the winning fork's outcomes
</ProseCard>

## Strategic Considerations

### For Dispute Participants
- High-conviction disputes are only worth posting if you're confident you'll win
- Later dispute rounds become prohibitively expensive for casual participants
- High-stakes disputes push the system toward fork, affecting all markets

### For Market Users
- Monitor disputes if your market outcome is challenged
- Disputed markets settle slower than undisputed ones
- High-risk markets might not settle until after a fork resolves

## Key Takeaways

- **Disputes escalate:** Each new dispute doubles the bond size (approximately)
- **Forks are triggered mechanically:** When the largest bond hits 275,000 REP
- **Risk is measurable:** The fork formula lets you calculate exactly how close we are
- **Escalation is expensive:** High-stakes disputes require serious financial commitment
- **Fork is ultimate resolution:** When community disagreement is severe, REP holders decide
