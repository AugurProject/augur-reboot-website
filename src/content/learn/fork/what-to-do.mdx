# What To Do During Rising Fork Risk

**TL;DR** — Fork risk is manageable at low levels. Monitor more closely as it rises. At high levels, take concrete action to protect your positions.

## Risk Overview

<ProseCard>
| LEVEL | SITUATION | YOUR ACTION |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| No Risk (0%) | No disputes active | Trade normally. Check meter occasionally. |
| Low (0-10%) | Early disputes | Identify which markets are disputed. Understand the disagreement. |
| Medium (10-25%) | Disputes escalating | Calculate your exposure. Think about exit strategies if needed. |
| High (25-75%) | Large bonds active | Monitor daily. Consider reducing exposure. Prepare for fork governance. |
| Extreme (75%+) | Fork imminent | Take action now. Prepare to choose a fork. Engage with community. |

## High Risk (25-75%) — Take Action

The gap to fork threshold is narrowing. Fork is increasingly likely with continued escalation.

**What you should do:**

- **Reduce exposure if uncomfortable** — Consider exiting disputed positions
- **Monitor daily** — Check the fork meter and dispute progress regularly
- **Understand the disagreement** — Review community discussions about the disputed outcome
- **Prepare for fork governance** — If a fork occurs, be ready to choose with your REP
- **Avoid new large bets** — Don't enter high-risk markets during escalation
- **Know your positions** — Understand exactly how a fork would affect you

## Extreme Risk (75%+) — Fork Is Likely

Fork threshold is nearly reached. A fork is imminent or may have been triggered. This is the highest-stakes scenario.

**What you must do:**

- **Understand your position** — Know exactly what outcome you're betting on in disputed markets
- **Plan your fork choice** — Which fork version do you believe represents the correct outcomes?
- **Prepare to migrate REP** — You'll choose which fork version to support during the 60-day period
- **Engage with the community** — Discuss the disputed outcomes with other REP holders
- **Be ready to act** — The fork period requires active participation and decision-making
- **Prepare for market freezes** — Disputed markets will be frozen until the fork resolves

## During a Fork Event

### The 60-Day Fork Period

- **Markets freeze:** No new trades on disputed markets
- **You must migrate REP:** Choose which fork version you support
- **Voting occurs:** Your REP migration determines your choice on the disputed outcome
- **Communicate:** Engage in governance discussions about the right outcome
- **Wait for resolution:** The fork window is 60 days

### After Fork Resolution

- **Check your REP:** You now have REP on the winning fork
- **Markets settle:** Markets settle according to the winning fork's outcomes
- **Resume trading:** Normal Augur operations resume
- **Evaluate impact:** Assess how the fork affected your positions

## General Best Practices

- **Check the meter regularly:** Make fork risk checking part of your routine
- **Understand disputed outcomes:** Know what you're betting on before a dispute arises
- **Size positions appropriately:** Don't over-commit to markets that could fork
- **Stay informed:** Follow Augur discussions and governance
- **Plan ahead:** Think through fork scenarios before they happen
- **Engage with the community:** Forks are community decisions
