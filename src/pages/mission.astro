          <p class="text-center text-foreground mb-8 mx-auto max-w-2xl">Augur has always represented a bold idea: <span class="text-loud-foreground">A decentralized oracle system that lets anyone ask and resolve questions about the future — without trusted intermediaries</span>. In 2025, the Lituus Foundation began rebooting Augur from the ground up, adapting its core ideas to a radically changed crypto landscape. Here's how our journey has unfolded so far:</p>

          <TimelineSection title="The Augur Reboot" date="March 31, 2025">
            <h3>Foundation Reset</h3>
            <p>We officially announced the reboot of Augur under the guidance of the newly formed <strong>Lituus Foundation</strong>. Our immediate priorities included:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Rebuilding infrastructure</strong> after years of project dormancy</li>
              <li><strong>Restoring confidence</strong> in the REP token by acquiring a significant treasury stake</li>
              <li><strong>Establishing clear direction</strong> for the oracle mechanism and community governance</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This marked the beginning of a deep research and development phase, focused on both <em>game-theoretic soundness</em> and <em>practical usability</em>.</p>
          </TimelineSection>

          <TimelineSection title="Generalized Augur" date="May 12, 2025">
            <h3>A Cross-Chain Decentralized Truth Machine</h3>
            <p>After early architectural planning, we recognized a key opportunity: <strong>Augur's oracle mechanism could be separated from prediction markets</strong> and offered as a standalone service.</p>
            <p>This vision became <em>Generalized Augur</em> — a universal, permissionless oracle protocol where:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Any user or application can pay a fee to request the resolution of any well-specified question</li>
              <li>The outcome is settled using Augur's upgraded fork-and-escalation resolution process</li>
              <li>Results can be posted to any EVM-compatible chain via bridging mechanisms</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This was a major conceptual expansion — from a niche oracle for a specific prediction market to a <strong>modular, cross-chain truth layer for Web3</strong>.</p>

          <TimelineSection title="Augur's Revival" date="July 1, 2025" isLast>
            <h3>Q1 and Beyond</h3>
            <p>Three months into the reboot, we published our first comprehensive progress report. Key updates included:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>REP treasury growth:</strong> From ~250k to over 550k tokens under Foundation stewardship</li>
              <li><strong>DEX liquidity provision:</strong> Over $100,000 deployed on Uniswap V3 to support token utility</li>
              <li><strong>Community and ecosystem building:</strong> Participation in major crypto events, dev outreach, and Discord engagement</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>R&D milestone:</em> Paused implementation of a prototype (AugurCP) after discovering a critical game-theoretic vulnerability. We're now conducting deeper oracle security research before proceeding.</p>
