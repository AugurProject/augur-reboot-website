Our immediate priorities included: Rebuilding infrastructure after years of project dormancy Restoring confidence in the REP token by acquiring a significant treasury stake Establishing clear direction for the oracle mechanism and community governance This marked the beginning of a deep research and development phase, focused on both game-theoretic soundness and practical usability."

          'After early architectural planning, we recognized a key opportunity: Augur’s oracle mechanism could be separated from prediction markets and offered as a standalone service. This vision became Generalized Augur — a universal, permissionless oracle protocol where: Any user or application can pay a fee to request the resolution of any well-specified question The outcome is settled using Augur’s upgraded fork-and-escalation resolution process Results can be posted to any EVM-compatible chain via bridging mechanisms This was a major conceptual expansion — from a niche oracle for a specific prediction market to a modular, cross-chain truth layer for Web3.',

Key updates included: REP treasury growth: From ~250k to over 550k tokens under Foundation stewardship DEX liquidity provision: Over $100,000 deployed on Uniswap V3 to support token utility Community and ecosystem building: Participation in major crypto events, dev outreach, and Discord engagement R&D milestone: Paused implementation of a prototype (AugurCP) after discovering a critical game-theoretic vulnerability. We’re now conducting deeper oracle security research before proceeding.',
