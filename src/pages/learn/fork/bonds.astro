	<h1>Dispute Process & Bonds</h1>

	<p>
		Bonds are the financial mechanism that makes Augur's dispute system work. They align incentives,
		prevent spam, and ensure serious participants have skin in the game.
	</p>

	<h2>What is a Dispute Bond?</html>

	<p>
		A dispute bond is REP (Augur's native token) that a user must lock up to challenge a market
		outcome. It serves three purposes:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			<strong>Skin in the game:</strong> Disputers must risk their own capital to challenge outcomes
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Spam prevention:</strong> High bond amounts deter frivolous disputes
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Fair resolution:</strong> The bond gets returned plus a fee if your dispute is correct
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>How the Dispute Process Works</h2>

	<p>
		Here's the step-by-step flow of a typical market dispute:
	</p>

	<h3>Step 1: Initial Report</h3>
	<p>
		The designated reporter submits their view of the market outcome (e.g., "Yes" for a binary market).
	</p>

	<h3>Step 2: First Dispute</h3>
	<p>
		If someone disagrees, they post an initial dispute bond (size varies based on protocol params) and
		submit their alternative outcome. If no one disputes this, the market settles with the dispute's outcome.
	</p>

	<h3>Step 3: Escalation</h3>
	<p>
		If another user disputes the dispute, they must post a bond that's typically 2x larger than the previous bond.
		This continues escalating with each dispute round.
	</p>

	<h3>Step 4: Fork Trigger</h3>
	<p>
		When a bond reaches or exceeds 275,000 REP, a fork is triggered instead of continuing escalation.
	</p>

	<h2>Bond Economics</h2>

	<ProseCard>
		<h3 class="text-loud-foreground font-bold mb-4">WINNING A DISPUTE</h3>
		<p class="mb-3">
			If your dispute outcome is chosen (by winning a fork or being accepted by the next disputer), you receive:
		</p>
		<ul class="space-y-1 mb-6">
			<li>Your original bond back</li>
			<li>A fee (additional REP as a reward for being right)</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 class="text-loud-foreground font-bold mb-4">LOSING A DISPUTE</h3>
		<p class="mb-3">
			If your dispute outcome is incorrect, you lose your bond. The bond is redistributed:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Some goes to winning disputers</li>
			<li>Some goes to the protocol or REP holders</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Bond Amounts Over Time</h2>

	<p>
		As disputes escalate, bond requirements grow exponentially:

	<h2>Strategic Considerations</h2>

	<h3>For Disputers</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>High conviction disputes:</strong> Only worth posting if you're confident you'll win
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Cost escalation:</strong> Later disputes become prohibitively expensive for casual participants
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Fork risk:</strong> High-stakes disputes push toward fork, which affects all markets
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>For Market Users</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Monitor disputes:</strong> Watch the fork meter if your market outcome is disputed
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Expect delays:</strong> Disputed markets settle slower than undisputed ones
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Fork possibility:</strong> High-risk markets might not settle until after a fork
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Current Metrics</h2>

	<p>
		The fork meter tracks:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Largest Dispute Bond:</strong> The biggest bond currently active across all markets
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Active Disputes:</strong> How many markets have ongoing disputes
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Fork Risk %:</strong> (Largest Bond ÷ 275,000 REP) × 100
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		These metrics give you a real-time view of how close Augur is to a fork event.
