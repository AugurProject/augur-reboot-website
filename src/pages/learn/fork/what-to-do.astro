	<h1>What To Do During Rising Fork Risk</h1>

	<p>
		Fork risk doesn't require panic, but it does require awareness and preparation. Here's what
		you should consider at each risk level.
	</p>

	<h2>Normal Risk (0%)</h2>

	<ProseCard>
		<h3 class="text-loud-foreground font-bold mb-3">WHAT'S HAPPENING</h3>
		<p class="mb-6">No active disputes. Markets are trading normally.</p>

		<h3 class="text-loud-foreground font-bold mb-3">WHAT TO DO</h3>
		<ul class="space-y-2">
			<li>Monitor market activity as usual</li>
			<li>Make trading decisions normally</li>
			<li>Check the fork meter occasionally to stay informed</li>
			<li>Consider how you'd respond if a dispute suddenly arises</li>
		</ul>
	</ProseCard>

	<h2>Low Risk (0-10%)</h2>

	<ProseCard>
		<h3 class="text-loud-foreground font-bold mb-3">WHAT'S HAPPENING</h3>
		<p class="mb-6">Early-stage disputes are active, but fork risk remains minimal.</p>

		<h3 class="text-loud-foreground font-bold mb-3">WHAT TO DO</h3>
		<ul class="space-y-2">
			<li>
				<strong>Identify disputed markets:</strong> Check which markets have active disputes
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Review outcomes:</strong> Understand the alternative outcomes being disputed
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Assess positions:</strong> Evaluate your exposure to disputed markets
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Stay informed:</strong> Check the fork meter more regularly
			</li>
		</ul>
	</ProseCard>

	<h2>Moderate Risk (10-25%)</h2>

	<ProseCard>
		<h3 class="text-loud-foreground font-bold mb-3">WHAT'S HAPPENING</h3>
		<p class="mb-6">Disputes are escalating. The largest bond is now significant, and fork conditions are becoming possible.</p>

		<h3 class="text-loud-foreground font-bold mb-3">WHAT TO DO</h3>
		<ul class="space-y-2">
			<li>
				<strong>Review disputed markets closely:</strong> Understand the arguments for each outcome
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Check exposure:</strong> Calculate how much REP/capital is at risk in disputed markets
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Consider exit strategies:</strong> Think about when you might exit disputed positions
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Follow dispute progress:</strong> Track each new dispute round
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Prepare for fork:</strong> Understand what a fork would mean for your positions
			</li>
		</ul>
	</ProseCard>

	<h2>High Risk (25-75%)</h2>

	<ProseCard>
		<h3 class="text-loud-foreground font-bold mb-3">WHAT'S HAPPENING</h3>
		<p class="mb-6">
			Large dispute bonds are active. The gap to fork threshold is narrowing. Fork is increasingly likely
			with continued escalation.
		</p>

		<h3 class="text-loud-foreground font-bold mb-3">WHAT TO DO</h3>
		<ul class="space-y-2">
			<li>
				<strong>Act on disputed market exposure:</strong> Consider reducing positions if you're uncomfortable
				with fork risk
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Prepare for fork participation:</strong> If a fork occurs, be ready to vote with your REP
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Watch the meter closely:</strong> Check daily or more often
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Understand fork mechanics:</strong> Review how your positions would be affected by a fork
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Engage with community:</strong> Discuss outcomes with other participants
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Avoid new large bets:</strong> Think carefully before entering high-risk markets
			</li>
		</ul>
	</ProseCard>

	<h2>Elevated Risk (75-100%+)</h2>

	<ProseCard>
		<h3 class="text-loud-foreground font-bold mb-3">WHAT'S HAPPENING</h3>
		<p class="mb-6">
			Fork threshold is at or nearly at capacity. A fork is imminent or has been triggered. This is
			the highest-stakes scenario.
		</p>

		<h3 class="text-loud-foreground font-bold mb-3">WHAT TO DO</h3>
		<ul class="space-y-2">
			<li>
				<strong>Prepare for fork governance:</strong> A fork period is likely about to begin
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Understand your position:</strong> Know exactly what you're betting on
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Plan your fork choice:</strong> Which outcome do you believe is correct?
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Prepare to migrate REP:</strong> During a fork, you'll need to choose which version to
				support
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Monitor governance channels:</strong> Engage with the community on the disputed outcomes
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Be ready to act during fork:</strong> The 60-day fork period requires active participation
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Prepare for market impact:</strong> Many markets will be frozen until fork resolves
			</li>
		</ul>
	</ProseCard>

	<h2>During a Fork Event</h2>

	<h3>The 60-Day Fork Period</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Markets freeze:</strong> No new trades on disputed markets
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>You must migrate REP:</strong> Choose which fork version you support
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Voting occurs:</strong> Your REP choice determines your vote on the disputed outcome
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Communicate:</strong> Engage in governance discussions about the right outcome
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Wait for resolution:</strong> The fork window is 60 days
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>After Fork Resolution</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Check your REP:</strong> You now have REP on the winning fork
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Markets settle:</strong> Markets settle according to the winning fork's outcomes
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Resume trading:</strong> Normal Augur operations resume
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Evaluate impact:</strong> Assess how the fork affected your positions
		</li>
	</ul>
