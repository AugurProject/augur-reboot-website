	<h1>Fork Trigger Mechanics</h1>

	<p>
		A fork doesn't happen randomly. It's triggered by a specific sequence of escalating disputes,
		each building on the previous one. Understanding this mechanism is key to grasping why fork
		risk increases over time.
	</p>

	<h2>The Dispute Escalation Process</h2>

	<p>
		When someone disagrees with a market outcome, they can post a dispute bond to challenge it.
		If someone disputes that dispute, the bond size grows. This escalation continues until one of
		two things happens:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			<strong>Agreement is reached:</strong> The dispute stops escalating and the market is settled.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Fork trigger is hit:</strong> The bond reaches or exceeds 275,000 REP, triggering a fork.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Bond Escalation Rules</h2>

	<p>
		Each new dispute bond is typically 2x the previous bond. This exponential growth means:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Early disputes have manageable bond amounts</li>
		<li>Later disputes become prohibitively expensive</li>
		<li>At some point, the next dispute would exceed 275,000 REP</li>
		<li>That's when the fork is triggered</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		<strong>Example:</strong> If a dispute bond reaches 150,000 REP, the next challenger would need
		to post 300,000 REP to dispute it. Since this exceeds the 275,000 REP fork threshold, a fork
		is triggered instead.
	</p>

	<h2>Why 275,000 REP?</h2>

	<p>
		The 275,000 REP threshold was chosen as a balance between:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Accessibility:</strong> Low enough that disputes can escalate naturally without
			requiring astronomical sums
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Safety:</strong> High enough that only serious, well-funded disputes trigger forks
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Governance:</strong> Ensures that protocol-level disagreements go to REP holders
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Fork Window Timing</h2>

	<p>
		Once a fork is triggered, there's a critical timing mechanism:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Fork Period:</strong> 60 days for REP holders to choose which fork they support
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>During Fork:</strong> Markets are frozen. No new trading occurs.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>After Fork:</strong> The winning fork becomes the canonical Augur. The losing fork
			essentially becomes abandoned.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Impact on Fork Risk</h2>

	<p>
		The fork risk percentage tells you how far the current largest dispute bond has escalated:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>0-25% risk:</strong> Still early in the dispute escalation</li>
		<li><strong>25-50% risk:</strong> Disputes are becoming serious</li>
		<li><strong>50-75% risk:</strong> Fork risk is becoming material</li>
		<li><strong>75-100% risk:</strong> Fork is imminent or may have already occurred</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		As bond amounts grow closer to 275,000 REP, the fork becomes increasingly likely. The fork
		meter visualizes this progression in real time.
	</p>

	<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>Forks are triggered by escalating dispute bonds, not arbitrarily</li>
		<li>The 275,000 REP threshold ensures meaningful disputes reach the protocol's highest level</li>
		<li>Once triggered, a 60-day fork period begins where REP holders vote on outcomes</li>
		<li>Understanding the escalation process helps you anticipate fork risk</li>
	</ul>
