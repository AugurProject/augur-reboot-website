	<h1>What is a Fork?</h1>

	<p>
		A fork in the Augur protocol is a critical mechanism that activates when the protocol
		faces a severe disagreement about market outcomes. If a market reaches a "fork trigger"
		through escalating dispute bonds, the protocol splits into two branches, each with its own
		version of market outcomes.
	</p>

	<h2>Why Forks Matter</h2>

	<p>
		Forks are Augur's ultimate security mechanism. They ensure that:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Disputes can be resolved</strong> - No single entity can control market outcomes</li>
		<li><strong>REP holders govern</strong> - The community decides which fork is "correct"</li>
		<li><strong>Bad actors face consequences</strong> - Invalid outcomes get rejected by the network</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>How Fork Risk is Measured</h2>

	<p>
		The fork meter visualizes how close Augur is to a fork event. It tracks the largest active
		dispute bond and measures it against the fork threshold (275,000 REP). The closer we get to
		this threshold, the higher the fork risk.
	</p>

		</p>
		<p class="text-center text-primary font-mono text-lg">
			(Largest Dispute Bond ÷ 275,000 REP) × 100 = Risk %
		</p>
	</div>

	<h2>Understanding Risk Levels</h2>

	<p>
		The fork meter displays five risk levels, each indicating how likely a fork is:

					<td class="py-2 px-3">25-75%</td>

					<td class="py-2 px-3 font-bold">ELEVATED</td>
					<td class="py-2 px-3">75-100%</td>

	<h2>What Happens During a Fork</h2>

	<p>
		When fork conditions are met, the Augur protocol enters a 60-day fork period:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>REP holders must choose which version of events they believe is correct</li>
		<li>REP is migrated to the chosen fork</li>
		<li>The fork with the most REP becomes the canonical Augur</li>
		<li>Markets on the losing fork become worthless</li>
		<li>Bets on the winning fork are settled according to that fork's outcomes</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		This is why monitoring fork risk is crucial—a fork event affects all open markets and requires
		active participation from REP holders.
