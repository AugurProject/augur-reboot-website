	<h1>What is a Fork?</h1>

	<p>
		A fork in the Augur protocol is a critical mechanism that activates when the protocol
		faces a severe disagreement about market outcomes. If a market reaches a "fork trigger"
		through escalating dispute bonds, the protocol splits into two branches, each with its own
		version of market outcomes.
	</p>

	<h2>Why Forks Matter</h2>

	<p>
		Forks are Augur's ultimate security mechanism. They ensure that:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Disputes can be resolved</strong> - No single entity can control market outcomes</li>
		<li><strong>REP holders govern</strong> - The community decides which fork is "correct"</li>
		<li><strong>Bad actors face consequences</strong> - Invalid outcomes get rejected by the network</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>How Fork Risk is Measured</h2>

	<p>
		The fork meter visualizes how close Augur is to a fork event. It tracks the largest active
		dispute bond and measures it against the fork threshold (275,000 REP). The closer we get to
		this threshold, the higher the fork risk.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Fork Risk Formula:</strong> (Largest Dispute Bond ÷ 275,000 REP) × 100 = Risk %
	</p>

	<h2>Understanding Risk Levels</h2>

	<p>
		The fork meter displays five risk levels, each indicating how likely a fork is:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Normal (0%):</strong> No active disputes. Markets are operating normally.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Low (0-10%):</strong> Small disputes exist, but fork risk is minimal.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Moderate (10-25%):</strong> Significant disputes are active. Monitor the situation.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>High (25-75%):</strong> Large dispute bonds create serious fork risk.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Elevated (75-100%):</strong> A fork is likely imminent. Take action immediately.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>What Happens During a Fork</h2>

	<p>
		When fork conditions are met, the Augur protocol enters a 60-day fork period:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>REP holders must choose which version of events they believe is correct</li>
		<li>REP is migrated to the chosen fork</li>
		<li>The fork with the most REP becomes the canonical Augur</li>
		<li>Markets on the losing fork become worthless</li>
		<li>Bets on the winning fork are settled according to that fork's outcomes</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		This is why monitoring fork risk is crucial—a fork event affects all open markets and requires
		active participation from REP holders.
	</p>
