	<h1>Risk Mitigation Strategies</h1>

	<p>
		While forks are a core feature of Augur's security model, there are strategies you can use to
		manage fork risk and protect your positions.
	</p>

	<h2>Position Management</h2>

	<h3>Size Your Positions Appropriately</h3>
	<p>
		Don't commit more capital to a market than you can afford to lose in a fork scenario. Consider:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Your total Augur exposure across all markets</li>
		<li>How much each individual position represents</li>
		<li>What percentage of your capital is at risk to disputed markets</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Diversify Across Risk Levels</h3>
	<p>
		Balance positions in different types of markets:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Low-risk markets:</strong> Established markets with clear outcomes, low dispute activity
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Medium-risk markets:</strong> Active markets with occasional disputes
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>High-risk markets:</strong> Markets with significant dispute activity (smaller positions)
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Avoid Concentration</h3>
	<p>
		Don't put a large percentage of your capital in any single disputed market. Spread positions
		across multiple markets and outcomes.
	</p>

	<h2>Market Selection</h2>

	<h3>Research Dispute History</h3>
	<p>
		Before entering a market, check:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Has this market been disputed before?</li>
		<li>How many dispute rounds has it gone through?</li>
		<li>Are there disagreements about the outcome?</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Choose Clear-Cut Markets</h3>
	<p>
		Markets with unambiguous, objective outcomes are less likely to be disputed. Avoid:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Markets dependent on interpretation or judgment</li>
		<li>Markets with significant external dependencies</li>
		<li>Markets where multiple "reasonable" outcomes exist</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Monitor Market Maturity</h3>
	<p>
		Established markets with long resolution periods typically have fewer disputes than newly resolved ones.
	</p>

	<h2>Time-Based Strategies</h2>

	<h3>Exit Before High Risk</h3>
	<p>
		Monitor the fork meter and consider exiting positions when risk rises:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Moderate risk (10-25%):</strong> Consider exiting or reducing positions
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>High risk (25-75%):</strong> Be very selective about remaining positions
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Elevated risk (75%+):</strong> Seriously consider exiting unless you have strong conviction
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Hedge with Short Positions</h3>
	<p>
		If you expect a disputed outcome:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			Consider hedging long positions with small short positions on alternative outcomes
		</li>
		<li>This reduces your directional exposure while keeping you in the market</li>
		<li>Useful during moderate risk periods</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Information Strategies</h2>

	<h3>Monitor Dispute Activity</h3>
	<p>
		Stay informed about what's being disputed:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Check the fork meter daily or more often during disputes</li>
		<li>Understand what outcomes are in conflict</li>
		<li>Follow community discussions about disputed outcomes</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Engage with Community</h3>
	<p>
		Participate in governance discussions:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Share your perspective on disputed outcomes</li>
		<li>Learn from other participants' views</li>
		<li>Build conviction about the "right" outcome</li>
		<li>Prepare for fork voting</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Plan Your Fork Position</h3>
	<p>
		Before a fork occurs, think through:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Which fork version would you support?</li>
		<li>Why would you choose that version?</li>
		<li>How would that choice affect your positions?</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Post-Fork Strategies</h2>

	<h3>Plan for Migration</h3>
	<p>
		During a fork, you'll need to migrate your REP to the fork version you support:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Understand the migration mechanics ahead of time</li>
		<li>Prepare your strategy before the fork window opens</li>
		<li>Ensure you can execute timely decisions</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Prepare for Market Freeze</h3>
	<p>
		Markets freeze during the 60-day fork period:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>You won't be able to exit positions during the fork</li>
		<li>Plan for this liquidity lock-up in advance</li>
		<li>Don't overcommit capital that you might need</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Monitor Fork Resolution</h3>
	<p>
		Once a fork is triggered:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Follow the 60-day voting period closely</li>
		<li>Make your fork choice based on conviction</li>
		<li>Be ready to migrate REP on a timeline you're comfortable with</li>
	</ul>
