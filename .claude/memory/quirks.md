# Quirks

Non-standard behaviors and workarounds.

## Astro Scoped Styles Default
Component <style> blocks auto-scoped with data-astro-cid-* attributes. Use is:global for truly global styles.

## Fork Risk Formula
(Largest Dispute Bond / 275,000 REP) × 100 = Risk %. Smaller denominator would severely underestimate risk.

## F2 Demo Mode
Press F2 in development to toggle 5 fork risk scenarios. Dev-only feature with production guards.

## RPC Endpoint Failover
Uses 4 public endpoints (LlamaRPC, LinkPool, PublicNode, 1RPC) with auto-fallback. No API keys needed.
